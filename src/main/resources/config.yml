#Want to sell the crops?
#Try this plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/shipping-bin.104591/
#You can use it with a command binding to an ItemsAdder furniture
#Shipping Bin is similar to the way how players sell items in Stardrew Valley

  # mode: tripwire / item_frame
  # This option requires a server restart
  # ------------ tripwire ------------
  # Advantage:
  #      ● async check, less lag
  #      ● Real block hitbox like vanilla
  #
  # Disadvantage:
  #      ● limited amount(127) /iainfo to see how many slots available
  #      ● visual problem when breaking crops
  #      ● Can't remove tripwire break sound
  #
  # ------------ item_frame ------------
  # Advantage:
  #      ● unlimited amount, create as many as crop types as you want
  #      ● No tripwire break sound
  #      ● Rotation
  #
  # Disadvantage:
  #      ● entities are very laggy(loading every 5~8 item frames need 0.01 mspt)
  #      ● spigot optimized the view distance of entities
  #      ● crops would go missing if there's a large amount of furniture replacing in the same tick(128 crops/tick)
  #      ● And I can't fix this in my plugin because furniture replacing is handled by ItemsAdder.
  #      ● No real block hitbox
  #      ● ItemsAdder furniture breaking sound
  #      ● itemsAdder loot system doesn't apply to furnitures.
